-----
This directory will contain Princeton Instruments hardware-specific Agents and
communication protocol clients.

The modules herein should be general to ALL PRINCETON INSTRUMENTS hardware, and
build upon AbstractAgents for the more general aspects of the needed Agents.

Currently, nothing is here.
