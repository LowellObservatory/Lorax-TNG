"""Lorax CCD Cooler SubAgent Abstract Class

This module is part of the Lorax-TNG package, written at Lowell Observatory.

This SubAgent is to be inherited by all protocol-based CcdCooler Agents, and
provides the complete API for all Lorax CcdCooler Agents (contained in the
:func:`handle_message` method).

The Lorax CCD Cooler API is as follows:
=======================================

    init
        Initialize and connect to the cooler
    disconnect
        Disconnect from the cooler
    status
        Broadcast the current status of the cooler
    set_temperature
        Set the temperature goal for the cooler
    set_temp_tolerance
        Set the temperature stability tolerance for the cooler
    power_off
        Turn the power to the cooler off (but don't disconnect)
    power_on
        Turn the power to the cooler on, set nominal temperature

class CcdCoolerSubAgent(SubAgent):
    """CCD Cooler SubAgent

    This SubAgent contains the methods common to all CCD COOLER instances,
    regardless of the hardware communication protocol.  Namely, the populated
    methods contained herein merely set instance attributes and do not
    communicate directly with the hardware.  Also, this class handles all of
    the cooler message commands, to minimize replication between pieces of
    hardware.

    Abstract methods are supplied for the functions expected to have hardware-
    specific implementation needs.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Agents and are fully implemented here; others are hardware-specific and
        are left as abstract methods for later implementation.

        Parameters
        ----------
